            <blockquote><p>You’re excited to buy land in the country and start living your dream. But there are some
                important things to consider about the land itself before making your purchase. You likely wouldn’t buy
                a house without walking through it first and opening a few cabinets. The same goes for land. Here are
                some things to look for:</p></blockquote>
            <p><img src="img/article-1-1.jpg" width="720" height="246"></p>
            <h2>Get the lay of the land</h2>
            <p>Getting the lay of the land you want to buy is vital to any future plans you have for it. Ideally, you’d
                be able to walk the land to identify wooded areas, any creeks or ponds that may be present, soil type
                and grade. This can help you determine where you want to build any structures, construct trails or erect
                animal pens. If you can’t walk the land, you’ll want to research it as much as possible online. Google
                Earth is a good place to start. You can use it to locate the property you are interested in buying and
                view the surrounding area. Even though the images may be a few years old, you can get a feel for the
                neighborhood. Switching to Google Street View can also help you get a look at what’s around.</p>
            <p><img src="img/article-1-2.jpg" width="720" height="246"></p>
            <h2>Does it 'perc'?</h2>
            <p>It has a quirky name, but a perc test can make or break your land deal if you plan to build there.
                Formally known as a percolation test, it measures how well your land absorbs water. This information is
                essential in determining how well your land can handle a septic system, which most rural tracts require
                when they will be used residentially. The test is relatively simple and generally costs between $350 and
                $500 for smaller tracts. It could be more depending on the level of work required. If your test fails,
                you might consider paying to have a septic system specially designed by an engineer, if possible.
                Otherwise, odds are you’ll need to look for another property.</p>
            <p><img src="img/article-1-3.jpg" width="720" height="246"></p>
            <h2>Know your boundaries</h2>
            <p>Knowing where your property ends and your neighbors’ property begins might seem pretty straightforward.
                But in some rural areas, the boundaries aren’t always clearly defined. You might need a property survey
                to make sure you know where your property lines are. This information would be essential if you are
                planning to build a fence or any other structure and could be required in some areas. The cost generally
                ranges from $1,000 to $4,500, depending on the complexity of the property, but having clearly defined
                boundaries could save you money in the long run. Find more information on surveyors in your state
                here.</p>

            <h2>What's it worth?</h2>
            <p>Knowing the value of the land you plan to purchase can be tricky. Getting a land appraisal will give you
                an idea of what a fair price would be and most likely will be required by your lender. An appraiser will
                consider factors such as recent nearby land sales, property terrain and possible uses for the land when
                offering an opinion on its value. An appraisal typically averages around $450 but could run $1,000 or
                more for complex properties.</p>
