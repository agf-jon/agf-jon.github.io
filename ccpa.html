            <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we may have disclosed the following categories of personal
                information for a business purpose:&nbsp; Categories A, B, D, F, I, J</p>

            <p>We disclose your personal information for a business purpose to the following categories of third
                parties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Legal entities established pursuant to the Farm Credit Act of 1971.</li>
                <li>Contracts and service providers.</li>
                <li>Third parties to whom we partner to offer products and services to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information.</p>

            <p><u>Your Rights and Choices </u></p>

            <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal
                information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></strong></p>

            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of
                your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
                request, we will disclose to you:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability
                    request).
                </li>
                <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists
                    disclosing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient
                            purchased; and
                        </li>
                        <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that
                            each category of recipient obtained.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong><em>Deletion Request Rights </em></strong></p>

            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you
                and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
                request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our
                records, unless an exception or good faith, commercially reasonable business justification applies.</p>

            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service
                providers to:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service
                    that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business
                    relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
                </li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
                    prosecute those responsible for such activities.
                </li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or
                    exercise another right provided for by law.
                </li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 ).</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public
                    interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's
                    deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you
                    previously provided informed consent.
                </li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your
                    relationship with us.
                </li>
                <li>Comply with a present or potential legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in
                    which you provided it.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></strong></p>

            <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable
                consumer request to us by either:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Calling us at 803-799-5000, ext. 2611</li>
                <li>Emailing <a href="mailto:customersupport@agfirst.com">customersupport@agfirst.com</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your
                behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a
                verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>

            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
                period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                    collected personal information or an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                    respond to it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We cannot provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
                the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's
                identity or authority to make the request.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format</em></strong></p>

            <p>Pursuant to the CCPA we will attempt to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty five (45)
                days of its receipt.&nbsp; If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and
                extension period in writing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Pursuant to the CCPA any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding
                the verifiable consumer request's receipt.&nbsp; The response we provide will also explain the reasons
                we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>

            <p>We typically do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is
                excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp; If we determine that the request warrants a fee,
                we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                request.</p>

            <p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>

            <p>AgFirst will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the
                CCPA, we will not:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or
                    other benefits, or imposing penalties.
                </li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
                    quality of goods or services.
                </li>
            </ul>
