            <h2>Third Parties</h2>
            <p>AgFirst may use third party suppliers and/or service providers to facilitate our services. For example,
                we may outsource one or more aspects of our website to a supplier or service provider who performs
                services according to our requirements. In all cases, AgFirst does not permit any suppliers or service
                providers to disclose or sell your information to third parties.</p>
            <h2>Legal Requirements</h2>
            <p>Federal or State law, or regulations, may require us to disclose confidential information in certain
                situations. Such situations include requests from law enforcement agencies or criminal or civil legal
                proceedings. We reserve the right to disclose any information we deem necessary to comply with any
                applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including personally identifiable
                information.</p>
            <h2>Security and Intrusion Detection</h2>
            <p>For website security purposes and to ensure that this site remains available to all users, traffic on the
                site is monitored to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or cause
                disruptions or damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this website are
                strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the law.</p>
            <h2>External Links - Weblinking</h2>
            <p>AgFirst may provide links to independent websites maintained by various federal agencies or other
                organizations, solely as a benefit to our customers. These other sites may have their own policies,
                which AgFirst does not control, and thus are not addressed by our policy. While we do our best to
                provide you with helpful, trustworthy resources, we do not endorse, approve or guarantee information,
                products, services or recommendations provided at any of the sites to which we have provided links.</p>
            <p>AgFirst is not responsible for the content or accuracy of any of these linked sites, nor are we
                responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the use of any linked websites. We are not liable for
                any failure of products or services advertised or provided on these linked sites. We offer these links
                on an "as is" basis.</p>
            <p>When you visit a linked website provided through our site, you will no longer be protected by our privacy
                policy or security practices. You should always familiarize yourself with the privacy policy and
                security practices of any website you visit.</p>
            <p>If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the links provided on our website, please call
                803-799-5000, ext. 2611, or send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customersupport@agfirst.com">customersupport@agfirst.com</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Suspicious Activity</h2>
            <p>Email and internet-related fraudulent schemes, such as &ldquo;phishing,&rdquo; are being perpetrated with
                increasing frequency, creativity and intensity. You should promptly report suspicious activity or email
                communications to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Send the actual email you received to uce@ftc.gov.
                If you believe you have been scammed, file your complaint at ftc.gov, and then visit the FTC's Identity
                Theft website ftc.gov/idtheft to learn how to minimize your risk associated from identity theft.</p>
            <p>If you receive a suspicious message that appears to be coming from AgFirst, or discover a potentially
                phony AgFirst website, please let us know by calling 803-799-5000, ext. 2611, or by sending e-mail to
                &nbsp;<a href="mailto:customersupport@agfirst.com">customersupport@agfirst.com</a>&nbsp;so that we may
                take appropriate action.</p>
            <h2>Effective Date</h2>
            <p>This policy was last modified in December 2012. When we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the
                revised policy here. As we may make changes at any time without notifying you, we suggest that you
                periodically consult this Privacy Policy.</p>
